title: Beginner Developer Tips&#58;<br> 5 Shortcuts in Atom to Increase Efficiency
---

As a beginner developer, I'm not the most efficient in my code and my habits yet. I am still learning, but I am always looking for little things to help me get faster, and overall more efficient. If you are just starting out, I want to share with you my 5 favorite shortcuts that have helped me become a bit faster. I've made use of these in Atom while developing on projects for my coursework.

{% ihighlight html %}Cmd + Shft + D   |{% endihighlight %}  <strong>Copy Line Below</strong><br>
<em>({% ihighlight html %}Ctrl + Shift + D {% endihighlight %} for Windows and Linux)</em>

This takes the line your cursor is on and makes an exact copy on the line below, pushing any lines below the current line down. I have found this helpful when referencing different script codes in an index that have the same or similar paths.

{% ihighlight html %}Cmd + ?   |{% endihighlight %}  <strong>Comment/Uncomment</strong><br>
<em>({% ihighlight html %}Ctrl +? {% endihighlight %} for Windows or Linux)</em>

This will comment out, or uncomment, the line of code your cursor is on or a full selection of lines. Helpful when adding comments for clarification or also when debugging, which I write about here.

![CmdQ Shortcut Gif](/img/postGif/cmdQ.gif)

{% ihighlight html %}Cmd + F   |{% endihighlight %}  <strong>Find/Replace</strong><br>
<em>({% ihighlight html %}Ctrl + F {% endihighlight %} for Windows or Linux)</em>

Need to find a certain variable easily? Did you rename one and need to change it? (Don't actually do this, ever, but if you do this might help.) This command will let you find what your looking for in the current file and will allow you to replace that one instance, or replace all instances, with your new variable name.

![CmdF Shortcut Gif](/img/postGif/cmdF.gif)

{% ihighlight html %}Cmd + Shft + F   |{% endihighlight %}  <strong>Find/Replace in Project</strong><br>
<em>({% ihighlight html %}Ctrl + Shft + F {% endihighlight %} for Windows or Linux)</em>

Similar to the previous shortcut this will find the variable you are looking for, but instead of simply looking in the current file it will look at all files across your entire project.

![CmdShftF Shortcut Gif](/img/postGif/CmdShftF.gif)

{% ihighlight html %}Cmd + Z   |{% endihighlight %}  <strong>Undo</strong><br>
<em>({% ihighlight html %}Ctrl + Z {% endihighlight %} for Windows or Linux)</em>

I know this one seems too simplistic to be on this list, but I think its worth noting that you can undo the last thing you typed, deleted, or moved. This comes in really handy when my 15 week old boxer puppy decides that he is going to replace my laptops position in my lap, and steps on the key board in the process. It's also helpful when I accidentally hit Cmd + X when trying to copy and paste.

These are just a few beginner tips from a beginner developer. As one person stated, “Developers do not like to do anything repetitive. There is probably a shortcut or fix that exists if you just Google it.” For more shortcut tips for Atom checkout [this repo by Nils Winkler](https://github.com/nwinkler/atom-keyboard-shortcuts).
